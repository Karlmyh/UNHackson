abstract = {Abstract Change-point detection is the problem of discovering time points at which properties of time-series data change. This covers a broad range of real-world problems and has been actively discussed in the community of statistics and data mining. In this paper, we present a novel nonparametric approach to detecting the change of probability distributions of sequence data. Our key idea is to estimate the ratio of probability densities, not the probability densities themselves. This formulation allows us to avoid nonparametric density estimation, which is known to be a difficult problem. We provide a change-point detection algorithm based on direct density-ratio estimation that can be computed very efficiently in an online manner. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments using artificial and real-world datasets. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Statistical Analysis and Data Mining 2011},

abstract = {Abstract Because the world with its markets, innovations, and customers is changing faster than ever before, the key to survival for businesses is the ability to detect, assess, and respond to changing conditions timely and intelligently. Understanding changes and reacting to or acting upon them therefore become a strategic issue not only for companies but also in many other domains. The corresponding need for knowledge has been answered by data mining research by proposing a multitude of methods for analyzing different aspects of change. This article provides an overview of recent works on methods for change analysis, thereby focusing on contrast mining and change mining, the two emerging subfields of contemporary data mining research. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

From a nonasymptotic point of view, we propose to estimate them with a method based on a penalized least-squares criterion. We choose the penalty function such that the resulting estimator minimizes the quadratic risk according to the results of Birgé and Massart. This penalty depends on unknown constants and we propose a calibration to obtain an automatic method. The performance of the method is assessed through simulation experiments. An application to real data is shown.}

abstract = {Objectives
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has drastically altered the global realities. Harnessing national scale data from the COVID-19 pandemic may better inform policy makers in decision making surrounding the reopening of society. We examined country-level, daily-confirmed, COVID-19 case data from the World Health Organization (WHO) to better understand the comparative dynamics associated with the ongoing global pandemic at a national scale.
Study design
Observational study.
Methods
We included data from 20 countries in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean and West Pacific regions, and obtained the aggregated daily new case data for the European Union including 27 countries. We utilized an innovative analytic approach by applying statistical change point models, which have been previously employed to model volatility in stock markets, changes in genomic data, and data dynamics in other scientific disciplines, to segment the transformed case data. This allowed us to identify possible change or turning points as indicated by the dynamics of daily COVID-19 incidences. We also employed B-spline regression models to express the estimated (predicted) trend of daily new incidences for each country’s COVID-19 disease burden with the identified key change points in the model.
Results
We identified subtle, yet different change points (translated to actual calendar days) by either the mean and variance change point model with small p-values or by a Bayesian online change point algorithm with large posterior probability in the trend of COVID-19 incidences for different countries. We correlated these statistically identified change points with evidence from the literature surrounding these countries’ policies regarding opening and closing of their societies in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. The days when change points were detected were ahead of the actual policy implementation days, and in most of the countries included in this study the decision lagged the change point days too long to prevent potential widespread extension of the pandemic.
Conclusions
Our models describe the behavior of COVID-19 prevalence at a national scale and identify changes in national disease burden as relating to chronological changes in restrictive societal activity. Globally, social distancing measures may have been most effective in smaller countries with single governmental and public health organizational structures. Further research examining the impact of heterogeneous governmental responses to pandemic management appears warranted.}

Analyzing how an increase of COVID-19 cases is related to the timing of opening K{\textendash}12 schools in the United States, we find that counties that opened K{\textendash}12 schools with in-person learning experienced an increase in the growth rate of cases by 5 percentage points on average, controlling for a variety of policies, past infection rates, and other factors. This association of K{\textendash}12 school visits with case growth is stronger when mask wearing is not mandated for staff at school. These findings support policies that promote masking and other precautionary measures at schools and giving vaccine priority to education workers.This paper empirically examines how the opening of K{\textendash}12 schools is associated with the spread of COVID-19 using county-level panel data in the United States. As preliminary evidence, our event-study analysis indicates that cases and deaths in counties with in-person or hybrid opening relative to those with remote opening substantially increased after the school opening date, especially for counties without any mask mandate for staff. Our main analysis uses a dynamic panel data model for case and death growth rates, where we control for dynamically evolving mitigation policies, past infection levels, and additive county-level and state-week {\textquotedblleft}fixed{\textquotedblright} effects. This analysis shows that an increase in visits to both K{\textendash}12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case and death growth rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K{\textendash}12 schools with in-person learning is associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the growth rate of cases. We also find that the association of K{\textendash}12 school visits or in-person school openings with case growth is stronger for counties that do not require staff to wear masks at schools. These findings support policies that promote masking and other precautionary measures at schools and giving vaccine priority to education workers.Anonymized comma-separated values data have been deposited in https://github.com/ubcecon/covid-schools.},

From the survey, we found: a relationship between the socioeconomic status and the digital divide in accessing remote learning, significant differences in students’ access to remote learning opportunities during the pandemic, and significant differences in access to digital tools between students in government schools and their private school counterparts. We also found a statistically significant association between parental level of education and the ability to support children's remote learning during the pandemic.}

The Corona virus has revealed emerging vulnerabilities in education systems around the world. It is now clear that society needs flexible and resilient education systems as we face unpredictable futures. A meta-analysis methodology was adopted for this study and pertinent literature was visited to capture the essence of continued learning during these unprecedented times. Findings reveal that universities worldwide are moving more and more towards online learning or E- Learning. Findings also reveal that apart from resources, staff readiness, confidence, student accessibility and motivation play important function in ICT integrated learning. This exploratory paper proposes that staff members should use technology and technological gadgets to enhance learning especially during these exceptional times. Findings also propose online and remote learning as a necessity in times of lock downs and social distancing due to COVID-19 pandemic. It also provides a strong platform for further research.},
